	Beware Underlanders, time hangs by a thread,
	the hunters are hunted, white water runs red
	The gnawers will strike to extinguish the rest,
	the hope of the hopeless resides in a quest
	An Overland warrior, a son of the Sun,
	he may bring us back light, he may bring us back none,
	but gather your neighbors and follow his call,
	or the rats will most surely devour us all
	Two over, two under, of royal descent,
	two flyers, two crawlers, two spinners assent
	One gnawer beside, and one lost up ahead,
	and eight will be left when we count up the dead
	The last one to die must decide where he stands,
	the fate of the eight is contained in his hands,
	so bid him take care, bid him look where he leaps
	so that life may be death, and death life again reaps

	If under fell, if over leaped,
	if life was death, and death life reaped,
	something rises from the gloom
	to make the Underland a tomb
	Hear it scratching down below,
	Rat of long forgotten snow
	Evil cloaked in coat of white,
	will the warrior drain your light?
	What could make the warrior weak?
	What do burning gnawers seek?
	Just a barely speaking pup,
	who holds the land of under up
	Die the baby, die his heart,
	die his most essential part,
	die the peace that rules the hour,
	gnawers have their key to power

	Warmblood now a bloodbourne death,
	will rob your body of it's breath,
	will mark your skin and seal your fate,
	the Underland becomes a plate

	Turn and turn and turn again,
	you see the what but not the when,
	remedy and wrong entwine,
	and so they form a single vine

	Bring the warrior from above,
	if yet his heart is swayed by love,
	bring the princess or despair,
	no crawlers care without her there

	Turn and turn and turn again,
	you see the what but not the when,
	remedy and wrong entwine,
	and so they form a single vine

	Those whose blood runs red and hot,
	must join to seek the healing spot,
	in the cradle, find the cure,
	for that which makes the blood impure

	Turn and turn and turn again,
	you see the what but not the when,
	remedy and wrong entwine,
	and so they form a single vine

	Gnawer, human, set aside,
	the hatreds that reside inside,
	for if the flames of war are fanned,
	all warmbloods lose the Underland

	Turn and turn and turn again,
	you see the what but not the when,
	remedy and wrong entwine,
	and so they form a single vine
